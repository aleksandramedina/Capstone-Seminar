### Progress, February 9


Now that the first technical challenge has been completed, I spent some time trying to figure out conceptually how to build out the second and most important part 
of the project, which is the algorithm. As per suggestions from an IM faculty professor, I spent a lot of time looking into ML5.js, however, I figured that, while it is 
really interesting, it doesn't quite align with the project that I had in mind.


After discussing with my capstone mentor, I decided to work out the structure of the algorithm will look like and how the different values will be stored. 


<!--  - how do I store the rules? (an array, when to apply it, where to apply it, the extent of its effect)
- set up one rule by the weekend
- called at random or triggered by certain actions?
    - one array for different behaviors
    - one array for what triggers it
- make a list of things I can detect; where would I implement that? how can I detect?
    - someone being idle for a certain amount of time -->
