### Progress, February 9


Now that the first technical challenge has been completed, I spent some time trying to figure out conceptually how to build out the second and most important part 
of the project, which is the algorithm. As per suggestions from an IM faculty professor, I spent a lot of time looking into ML5.js, however, I figured that, while it is 
really interesting, it doesn't quite align with the project that I had in mind.


After discussing with my capstone mentor, I decided to work out the structure of the algorithm will look like and how the different values will be stored. 


Here are the technical challenges that I need to figure out:
- how do I store the rules?
    - an array
    - one array for different behaviors
    - one array for what triggers it
- when do I apply the rules?
- where do I apply the rules?
- what is the extent of its effect?
- called at random or triggered by certain actions?


Next to do:
- set up one rule that will incorporate the whole structure
    - make a list of things I can detect
        - someone being idle for a certain amount of time
    - where would I implement that?
    - how can I detect it?
