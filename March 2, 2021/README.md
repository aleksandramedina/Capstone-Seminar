### Progress, March 2

This week I worked on finalizing the integration of ngrok, which will allow me to do a live demonstration during Tuesday's presentation. This took more than a week 
to complete and the help of my mentor and many other IM professors, which I am very thankful for!


I also finalized five interferances for the live presentation:
- first: ellipse height is set to equal one so it looks like a thin line
- second: RGB values are randomized, which creates a fun effect
- third: x and y coordinates are swapped
- fourth: instead of ellipses, users draw with squares
- fifth: no interferance


I was also working on my presentation [(linked here)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kj00JUFNbiQNDQ7cC8EOIxF5MDvebRCt/view?usp=sharing) and started drafting thoughts for the paper that I will have to hand in as a first draft quite soon. I have also 
reached out to two people who have agreed to give me in-depth user testing feedback.
