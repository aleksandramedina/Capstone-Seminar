### Progress, March 16

This week I focused on two main things:
- writing the first draft for my final paper to submit to my mentor
- laying out a plan with Aaron about next steps that I can realistically achieve until the end of the semester


Next steps for the project:
- go through [this](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/) resource and come up with as many drawing tools or 'interferences' as possible
- explore [Perlin noise](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noise)
- experiment with millis and time frames using [this](https://editor.p5js.org/runemadsen/sketches/Sks43yteM) resource

Once I have the library completed, I can put it all together under one pricniple of controlled randomneess.


Main focus points for the essay:
- Sol LeWitt
- Dadaism
- Bringing users joy, rather than frustration
- When it comes to digital artists, the line between human creation vs AI
  - Procreate
  - Imposter Syndrome
