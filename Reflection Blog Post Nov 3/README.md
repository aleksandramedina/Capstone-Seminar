**Ideas to explore after call with prof. Heather:**
- exquisite corps & similar games
- giving my AI a personality / multiple personalities: brainstorm these
- PRIOR WORK: continue researching previous collaborative networked art

**Next steps after call with mentor prof. Michael:**
- try out the simple first step P5 sketch
- try networking it
- ask Aaron and Mang if AI would be helpful / if there's anything I can pick up relatively fast

**Fun p5 sketches I found, which I could incorporate as drawing 'tools':**
