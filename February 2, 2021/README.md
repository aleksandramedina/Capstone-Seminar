### Progress, February 2


I have achieved all the goals I set for myself this week! After user testing and discussions with my capstone mentor, I concluded that the interactions the p5 sketch needs are:
- color picker
- eraser
- slider that defines brush size


At first, I was following a p5 [example](https://editor.p5js.org/am7625/sketches/LNeGD4ziq) I found online. While it was way too complicated for my needs, it was a useful guide to use as I was disecting the components I will need for my own sketch.


[Here](https://editor.p5js.org/am7625/sketches/VGG-ml5aT) is a link to my sketch that has all the three components needed for my mvp (minimum viable project). I want to keep it lean and simple before I introduce the algorithm to make sure that the difficulty of the p5 sketch is not holding me back.


I have also successfully incorporated these elements in my networked code. Now that this part is finished, I can move on to the next half and start creating the algorithm. I will start this by becoming more familiar with ml5.js, something that professor Ang suggested to me.
