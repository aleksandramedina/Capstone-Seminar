# Reflection Blog Post
##  October 27


So far in my progress I have settled on my core concept, which is to challenge the relationships people have with each other and their machines. The process of writing my midterm paper helped me focus my thoughts and crystalize a more concise concept. I like the direction of including the core ideas from Dadaism, when introducing the ideas of instructions, randomness and control. These are concepts I want to play with in my project.


I think it’s an interesting idea to play with the preconceived roles of a computer and a human user. In my project, I want the user to follow instructions, while the computer creates randomness. 


The current idea is:

- there are two computers, one for each user
- the two users are on the same team working towards the same goal
- their goal is to create a collaborative digital art piece 
- there are some basic instructions given to the users
- there are some things they can change:
    - color
    - stroke
    - ?
- the users can communicate with each other via a physical component that lets them send simple messages:
    - yes
    - no
    - ?
    - finish
- the computer code generates randomness by intruding with the art piece
- the computer code can also intrude with the messages or send false messages


The goal is to test if users will be able to collaborate and create something that they’re both happy with. Will they see the randomness created by the computer as frustrating or exciting? How will they communicate with each other?


Some things I am still struggling with / would like to hear an opinion on:
- How detailed should the instructions be?
- How much should the computer intrude so it doesn’t become too frustrating?
- What do you think about the physical communication component? Should I add more message options so that people can try to develop their own way of sending more detailed messages?


**Big Q:** What should be my next steps? I am not sure how to move forward now.


The feedback I’ve received so far can be split in two groups. Feedback from my classmates from this Capstone cohort and feedback from everyone else. When telling this to people outside of our class, I feel that people are mostly confused about the idea and are not quite sure what I am trying to do. I am not sure if this means that I should simplify my idea (however, then I am unsure if this still would be a big enough project to qualify as a capstone project) or that I simply need to work on my ‘elevator pitch’. From my classmates I received a lot of good feedback from the early stages of me prototyping the idea. 


Simran introduced me to the project “We Are Not Strangers”, which I thought was a great project, however, it made me think of whether I really want this to be a collaborative project between humans. My main goal is not to prove that humans ‘are not strangers’ and are, for a lack of better words, more humane than machines. This concept has been brought up countless times, and I think it would be more interesting to reverse the roles of humans and machines and move into a conversation about our trust in machines and how we see them overall. 


I am curious to hear the feedback from my first extended review today, but, most importantly, I would really appreciate some guidelines on how to move forwards as I am feeling a little stuck.
