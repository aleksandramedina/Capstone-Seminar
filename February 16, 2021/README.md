### Progress, February 16

I have been researching some artists that I added to my blog post las week throughout the week. I have also worked on creating two lists:
- what can I measure?
- what can I change / add / remove / do?


**What can I measure?**
- time
  - I wanted the background color to change if the user hasn't moved their mouse for more than 5 seconds. I am using millis(), however, I ran into some difficulties, which Jack is helping me to figure out.
- position
  - Successfully incorporated one example. The ellipse has a black outline, when the mouse is in the right most side of the canvas. View [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KAglehl5kaoeerGkLdbYuOie8EwptUXz/view?usp=sharing).
- color
- movement


**What can I change?**
- size of ellipse
- shape
- background color
- canvas size
- fill
- stroke
- ellipse parameters
- hue
- sasturation
  - Successfully implemented this.


**What can I add / do?**
- mirroring
- add effects
- add animations
