## Weekly Update, November 17

**Contents:**
- a list of instructions for the first prototype for the users to follow
- analysis of two prototype tests

### Prototyping

As discussed in my previous blog post, the platform I have chosen to test my concept is Google Drawings. Also, following my discussion of the difficulties and shortcomings of testing the concept of the mischievous virus, I have decided to test that separately through another platform. In this iteration I tested how people interacted with each other through Google Drawings, how successfully they interacted with the tools available to them, if they communicated with each other and how successful they were with following the instructions to come to a shared result.

- [Do It: The art of Instructions](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jul/09/do-it-manchester-festival)


**Instructions:**

Draw a car.

1. Pick a color that is good for sketching.
2. Draw two circles next to each other on the same plane - these will be the tires.
3. Now add the carcass of the car. The top of it is dome shape - like the Vokswagen Beetle.
4. The car is driving towards your right side.
5. Now add windows. There are two windows - at the driver's seat and the passanger's side.
6. Now add doors. There are two doors and two door handles.
7. Color the car in the iconic Volkswagen Beetle color.

These instructions are a mix of detailed and vague guidelines. I constructed this specifically so that I can see how users interact with each other in the two different scenarious.

**Communication**

To further test people's willingness / need to communicate, I have decided to give each user the chance to communicate three messages:
- yes
- no 
- ?
