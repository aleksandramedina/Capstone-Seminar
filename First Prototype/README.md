**Title:** Disconnected art

> "Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral" - Melvin Kranzberg

The goal of this project is to create a self generating art piece that can be loosely controlled by two people at the same time. How this will happen, I'm not sure yet. Possibly by an interface where two participants have to figure out a way to coordinate the same interaction with the computer code in order to affect the art piece to their own liking. This could be a p5 sketch that is largely randomized but some variables can be controlled / imposed, if the two participants find a way to coordinate their efforts via the interface. If the users fail to complete a task together, the program "punishes" them.

Possible interactions:
* one user controls the x coordinate of the mouse, while the other user controls the y coordinate

What can be changed / controlled:
* color
* direction
* randomization distribution
* stroke
* amplitude
