@@ Artist Statement

It is difficult to tie yourself down to one interest, one industry or one career - at least that’s what I’ve always thought. I never believed in specializing in one small thing. Everyone should have a portfolio of skills, so each new challenge or project in their work or personal lives can be approached from multiple perspectives, bridging skills from one experience to another. 

That is why I decided to call myself an Interactive Media artist. Not because I see myself as an artist. I see myself as the middle grounds between the technical, logical, and strategic and the artistic, inquisitive, and aesthetic. I like Mark Rothko, Saint Laurent, and techno music, but at the same time I also love differential equations, reading books about black holes and parallel words, and writing code.

This is what I want to be reflected in my work. The thoughtfulness that can only come from bringing in perspectives from different industries and different people. And importantly - I want it to be beautiful. There is enough gore and destruction around us, so I want my work to bring people some sense of happiness - even if it is just a little bit. People love beautiful things. Some times even more than practical things. My goal with my work is to combine those  two. Always strive to create beautifully practical solutions.
