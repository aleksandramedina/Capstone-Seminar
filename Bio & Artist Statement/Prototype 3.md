## Third Prototype

This week I thought more about two things:
- does it still make sense to use self-generating computer art?
- how would the physical component look?


First, I am considering what I want the resulting art piece to look like. Do I want it to be computer generated with human adjustments or human generated with computer interruptions?

**Types of computer generated art I have considered:**

In the case of human generated, computer interrupted art, I have been taking inspiration from [glitch art](https://www.behance.net/collection/179486749/capstone)
