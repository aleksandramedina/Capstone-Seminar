**Things I have finished this week:**
- implemented the randomness method so that users are no longer assigned one instruction throughout their session
- integrated Aaron's Perlin noise example and successfully networked it across multiple sketches
- fixed all bugs with the current seven instructions
- create a [system](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1co-59dn0OpSGzj9Jd8QFbSQouFxHjXFc/view?usp=sharing) for the algorithm the "announce" itself

**What still needs to be done:**
- add a feature that allows for a natural end to the game, such as a feature to save the finished artwork as a JPEG


**User testing:**
