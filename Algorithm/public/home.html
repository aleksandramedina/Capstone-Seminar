<h3>What is this and how can you participate?</h3>
<p>This is a fun and creative exercise that you will be working on together with your
partner. Each of you will be following the same instructions with some intentional vagueness,
with the goal of creating a collaborative art piece in real time. You are not allowed to
communicate with each other, except with the tools provided on this web browser.</p>

<p>There is a fun little twist though. There is a third entity that will be working together with
you today. An algorithm has been created that will from time to time alter your output to make
the process more creative and the result more unpredictable.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<h3>Your task today: Draw a car</h3>

<div class="row">

  <div class="column">
    <ul>
      <li>Pick a color that is good for sketching.</li>
      <li>Draw two circles next to each other on the same plane - these will be the tires.</li>
      <li>Now add the carcass of the car. The top of it is dome shape - like the Vokswagen Beetle.</li>
      <li>The car is driving towards your right side.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="column">
    <ul>
      <li>Now add windows. There are two windows - at the driver's seat and the passanger's side.</li>
      <li>Now add doors. There are two doors and two door handles.</li>
      <li>Color the car in the iconic Volkswagen Beetle color.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
