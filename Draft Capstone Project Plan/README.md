Below is my rationale and attached are two tentative documents:
- budget
- timeline


## Rationale

My capstone project is a two-user interactive painting game. This will require each user to have one iPad. In order to make the drawing process as easy and non-frustruating as possible, an Apple Pencil would be ideal.

Other than that there is not a lot I need. Depending on whether this will be possible to execute in-person, I might choose to also incorporate the physical component, which does not require more than what can be found in the I lab. The two most expensive componenets would be the two Arduino Unos.
