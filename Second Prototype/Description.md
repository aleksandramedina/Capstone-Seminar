## Second Prototype

After the first round of feedback, I realized that I can't make the game / collaborative project too difficult or users will simply give up. Some other ideas included uniting people that don't know each other, instead of testing whether technology brings us together or tears apart. However, a game that tries to unite strangers, might be a good way to test this question. 


For my second prototype I have decided to adjust two details:

- Add a physical component. I want users to be able to send somewhat cryptic messages to each other. For example, sending such signals as 'yes', 'no', 'up', 'down', 'right', 'left'.
