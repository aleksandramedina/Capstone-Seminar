## Second Prototype

After the first round of feedback, I realized that I can't make the game / collaborative project too difficult or users will simply give up. Some other ideas included uniting people that don't know each other, instead of testing whether technology brings us together or tears apart. However, a game that tries to unite strangers, might be a good way to test this question. 


For my second prototype I have decided to adjust two details:

- Add a physical component. I want users to be able to send somewhat cryptic messages to each other. For example, sending such signals as 'yes', 'no', 'up', 'down', 'right', 'left'.

- To test the hypothesis of whether technology brings people together or alienates them, I wanted to put the two subjects on one team together and pit them against the computer. This is different than when I originally thought of them working against each other with separate goals in mind. This idea includes the two users working towards the same collaborative art goal (still quite similar to prototype 1) but not being able to contact each other in real life. However, they will be able to send each other simple signals though some sort of physical component like, for example, an Arduino. This will allow them both to work collaboratively towards the same goal of making an abstract art piece. However, the computer will be an "unreliable" partner in this situation. It will send through some of the signals, but some of them will be distorted. There will be no way for the users to know which signal is real and which has been tampered with. I want to see how they will end up collaborating with each other and what will be the end result of their collaborative art piece.

Importantly, I want the prompt for the collaborative art piece to be somewhat ambiguous like "happiness", "summer" or "breakfast". I want to see how people can collaborate with each other when they each have a separate idea in their minds.
