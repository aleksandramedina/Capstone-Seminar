### Progress, January 26

So far I have succeeded in two initial technical difficulties, which I am very happy about since the hardest part always is starting. 
According to my timeline, I am currently in the Initial Userface Implementation phase. This phase includes:
- incorporate finalized sketch concept into code (what will the user interface look like)
- network the two sketches

I have made progress on both milestones I have set myself:


[Here](https://editor.p5js.org/am7625/sketches/LNeGD4ziq) is a link to the p5 sketch I have made. While it is not the finalized version,
it is a strong enough version to allow for user testing.


[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D6a9-6gmc2MNWzC6-Tfg2lQ2NVmnSLVH/view?usp=sharing) is a link to a screen recording I have made of my 
initial steps towards linking two p5 sketches. As you can see these are elementary example sketches that I used to make sure I network 
these two pages properly.

I have also uploaded my code unto GitHub.

Here is a screenshot of the current layout of the website I will be hosting my project on. Of course all of this is still work in progress.

My next steps include:
- finalize the p5 sketch to include all interactions 
- incorporate this sketch into the networked code


After these steps I will move onto creating the algorithm.
