### Progress, February 23


[Simran's suggested talk](https://vimeo.com/110607681)


I had two main focuses for this week:
- make the website more 'presentable'

- connect to ngrok so I can share a live demo during my presentation


- In the meantime I have continued exploring instructions and have settled on three instructions that I will demo for my midterm presentation. The way this has been set up (for now; I am planning to integrate the mechanism that will initiate the behaviors after midterm) is that, when a user opens a new window (creating a new connection), a function is called that randomly assigns one instruction throughout the duration of the connection. These four instructions are:
  - Instruction 1: no 'interruptions' from the algorithm
  - Instruction 2: x and y coordinates swaped
  - Instruction 3: height of the ellipse = 1 so it appears as a line instead of a thick brush
