## Prototyping

In this blog post I wanted to start brainstorming ideas on how to develop my first prototype to start user testing before I commit to any major decisions that might actually not work for the end user. This is important in order to test interest and effectively use my time.

The prototype needs to have a few characteristics:
- it needs to take advantage of a pre-existing networked software, such as any of the services provded by google drive
- it has to allow users to express their creativity to at least some limited extent
- it has to allow me to interfere with their end product imitating the algorithm that eventually will act as a 'rascal virus'


I've done some research and, luckily (?), because of Covid-19 and WFH, there are many online whiteboard tools readily available for people to use. The best free tool I found is [Microsoft's Whiteboard tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-whiteboard/digital-whiteboard-app). The only downside to it is that anyone that I'd ask to test my project would need to download the application, which is a little more time consuming and can be a little annoying to people. Therefore, I think this tool won't work for rapid prototype testing.


I checked out the options google drive has since it is something every NYU student is familiar with and has immediate access to. Turns out (maybe I'm the only one who wasn't aware of this) that there is a Google Draw tool, which is the perfect tool for me. It allows for real-time remote drawing together with its scribble option. It also has the commenting option which would allow me to see (without suggesting it to the subjects) whether people will naturally try to communicate with each other, what will they say, and how they will say it.

This is also ideal because it will allow me to engage as well playing the role of the algorithm.
