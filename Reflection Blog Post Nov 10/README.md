## Prototyping

In this blog post I wanted to start brainstorming ideas on how to develop my first prototype to start user testing before I commit to any major decisions that might actually not work for the end user. This is important in order to test interest and effectively use my time.

The prototype needs to have a few characteristics:
- it needs to take advantage of a pre-existing networked software, such as any of the services provded by google drive
- it has to allow users to express their creativity to at least some limited extent
- it has to allow me to interfere with their end product imitating the algorithm that eventually will act as a 'rascal virus'
